# HQ Trivia Acebot

HQ Trivia Acebot uses 2 powerful search methods to find the most likely answer for HQ Trivia questions.
It is run on a powerful server with gigabit internet speeds, meaning it can process much more data and information that a standard pc, increasing the number of correct answers, however this bot can't promise all correct answers due to HQ always striving to make HQ as hard as possible to bot or search answers, by making 'decoy' questions, obvious to humans, but that are able to trick a bot. For more infomation about this and what types of questions to do yourself, check out the FAQ section.

Features:
-
* 2 Powerful Search Methods
* AI can detect Anti-Bot questions
* AI picks the best of the two search methods based on the type of question, giving a 85+% accurancy (on average)
* Powerful Server running 24/7
* Server running Gigabit internet speeds
* New features and search methods constantly being created to give you the edge over other competitors
* The bot runs on our servers, not your wifi, meaning it is impossible for you to get banned for cheating.
* Regulary updated to bypass new restrictions / measures created by HQ Trivia





Curently supporting these HQ games:
-
-> UK (@2PM + 8PM UTC, as well as all 'suprise' games) *

-> US probably will never be supported as the prizes are much lower on average. If you are from the US, contact me as i can sell you a UK HQ trivia account for £2

*For this game, the £ sign sometimes changes to a $ when showing the next game time. This is a problem with HQ itself, and occurs in their app too in the UK game. It is not a glitch in the bot, but rather a problem with HQ itself.

# How To Use

Step 1
-
Navigate to https://repl.it/repls/MediumblueRightCron in a browser window on your computer (phones work, but are too small to see and use, plus increase difficulty of switching tabs back to HQ etc.)

Step 2
-
Click the button that says 'run', with the play button near the top

Step 3
-
When prompted for the password for the server (in the terminal on the right side of the screen), input the password that was given by me when you payed, and press the enter button on your keyboard.

Step 4
-
The bot should now be running :) yay! Just now keep the browser window open, when a new question gets detected, the bot will try and find an answer, and then it will be displayed on the screen, in the terminal.

FAQ
-
Q: As the client is made in python, can i just copy the code and run it from my computer directly in my python environment

A: Of course! The reason why the client is on repl.it is so people don't have to install a python environment, and can run the bot from ANYWHERE, but if you want to run it on your computer directly, feel free, but make sure to use python 3.x, as the client isn't compatible with python 2

Q: Why is the bot not getting every question right?

A: It would be impossible to create a bot that wins every time, and that it probably be the end of HQ if that was the case. I have tried to make it as accurate as possible, however there are specific instances where common sense is needed.

Q: The bot has said this question is an anti-bot question? What can i do?

A: The bot detects specific types of questions which hq uses to throw off bots, which try and eliminate everyone who is using a bot. When one is found, method 2 tends to be more accurate, however your best bet is to do your best guess yourself for these questions.


# Pricing

Currently, until all the bugs have been completely ironed out, and the answer searcher is as accurate as possible, the bot will be completely FREE. 

While the bot is free, use the password 'test' (without quote marks, all lowercase) to gain access to the bot. Once the bot gets made paid, it will change weekly.

The price of access of the bot will (hopefully) decrease over time, as more people become intrested, as the money only needs to cover the running server costs (expensive!), and recoup the costs of the server during development. This bot is created for the greater good, not profit.

You may share a code with friends, and split the cost etc., however you may NOT post an access code that you have online. If you want to test the bot before buying, please contact me.

In the unlikely event that the bot goes down for any reason, i would be more than happy to reinburse the cost for the duration bot over the time the bot goes down and/or extend the access time for the bot by the duration of the bot downtime.
